# vuejs2-wysiwyg  
Basic implementation of jquery summernote plugin for vuejs2.  

There is no obvious way of using any wysiwyg editors with REST Service bassed single page application on ```vue 2.0.0^```. Most of the packages on GitHub and other places either work with node modules or does not work on ```vue v2.0```. I actually spent lots of hours to find one and fell short on this goal. I ended up modifying the one in ```Haixing-Hu/vue-html-editor``` which works on with ```vue v1.0```.  

## Usage
It's very straight forward. Just look at the code. You can also take a look at the fiddle.
